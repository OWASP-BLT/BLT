## Middle Ground - Evaluate Further

### Maybe Keep (41-60)
- **About Us, Features, Teams** - Support pages
- **Hackathons, Social Links** - Community engagement
- **Roadmap, Status** - Transparency features

### Consider Removing (61-80)
- **Jobs, Funding, Donations** - Not core product
- **Stats pages** - Analytics, not functionality
- **Messaging, Rooms, Video Call** - Communication tools
- **Map, GSOC PR Reports** - Peripheral features

## Impact Analysis

### If Top 20 Are Prioritized:
- **Clear focus** on vulnerability discovery & bug reporting
- **Strong education** pathway for contributors
- **Effective incentive** system through bounties & BACON
- **Streamlined navigation** = better user experience

### If Bottom 10 Are Removed:
- **Reduced complexity** - easier to understand product
- **Faster development** - fewer features to maintain
- **Better focus** - team energy on core mission
- **Clearer value prop** - what BLT actually does
