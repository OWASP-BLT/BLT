# Terms and Conditions

**Last updated: December 11, 2024**

By using the OWASP BLT website ("Service"), or any services of BLT ("BLT"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service"). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of an organization or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access our services through your account to these terms and conditions. In such cases, the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity, its affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority or do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use the services.

> **Note:** If you are accessing any BLT service as a government entity, special terms may apply to you.

If BLT makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

> **Warning:** Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your account. While BLT prohibits such conduct and content on the Service, you understand and agree that BLT cannot be responsible for the content posted on the Service, and you may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

## Key Terms

1. You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.
2. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
3. You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested to complete the signup process.
4. Your login may only be used by one person. Sharing a single login among multiple people is not permitted.
5. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. BLT cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

7. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.
8. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).

## API Terms

Customers may access their BLT account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses BLT, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:

- You expressly understand and agree that BLT shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
- Abuse or excessively frequent requests to BLT via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. BLT will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
- BLT reserves the right to modify or discontinue your access to the API at any time, with or without notice.

## Account Cancellation

- You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen.
- All of your content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled.
- BLT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time.

## Copyright and Ownership

- We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. However, by setting your pages to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your content. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories.
- BLT does not pre-screen content, but BLT and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) to refuse or remove any content available via the Service.
- You shall defend BLT against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against BLT by a third party alleging that your content, or your use of the Service in violation of this agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law.

## General Conditions

- Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
- Support for BLT services is only available in English, via email.
- BLT uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.
- You must not modify, adapt, or hack the Service or modify another website to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service.
- We may remove content and accounts that we determine are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
- Verbal, physical, written, or other abuse of any BLT customer, employee, member, or officer will result in immediate account termination.

- You expressly understand and agree that BLT shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages.

- The failure of BLT to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and BLT and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and BLT. You agree that these Terms of Service and your use of the Service are governed under California law.
