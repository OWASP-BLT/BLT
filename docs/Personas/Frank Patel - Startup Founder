He’s operating on a tight budget and needs affordable QA testing, basic vulnerability reporting, and actionable user feedback to improve his product. Frank isn’t a cybersecurity expert — he just wants to make sure his site is stable, functional, and safe before investing heavily in marketing or growth.

🧭 Motivations

1. Low-Cost Quality Assurance

Frank wants people to bang on his website and find:
	•	broken links
	•	UI glitches
	•	functional bugs
	•	performance issues

He doesn’t need elite hackers — just reliable feedback.

2. Basic Vulnerability Reporting

He knows security matters, but he doesn’t have the budget for:
	•	pen tests
	•	security consultants
	•	enterprise bug bounty programs

He wants essential security checks at a price he can afford.

3. Feedback from Real Users

He needs:
	•	usability feedback
	•	suggestions for improvement
	•	a sense of what early customers think

4. Build Confidence Before Launching Big

He wants to make sure the product is solid before:
	•	advertising
	•	seeking investment
	•	onboarding customers
