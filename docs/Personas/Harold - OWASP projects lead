⭐ Biography

Harold oversees a large ecosystem of OWASP-affiliated tools, libraries, and documentation projects. He collaborates with hundreds of maintainers and community contributors around the world. Because the OWASP community produces widely trusted security software, Harold takes the security of every project seriously.

However, vulnerability reports arrive across multiple channels—emails, GitHub issues, Slack messages, Twitter DMs—making it nearly impossible to maintain a standardized, responsible disclosure process at scale.

He wants a single, structured platform where:
	•	All OWASP projects can be centrally managed
	•	Community researchers can be rewarded
	•	He can run official OWASP bug bounty challenges
	•	Teams and chapters can collaborate efficiently
	•	Sensitive disclosures are handled securely
