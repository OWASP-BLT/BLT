# Funding Proposal

## Introduction

We are seeking funding to support the continued development and maintenance of **OWASP BLT**. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to onboard a group of talented interns to contribute to the development of new features, improve usability, and expand the reach of the project. This proposal outlines our funding requirements and the planned allocation of those funds.

## Intern Program Plan

As part of our initiative, we plan to engage **10 contributors** under the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) model. We have already secured **4 official GSoC slots**, each funded at **$3,000**, amounting to a total of **$12,000** in confirmed support.

To ensure parity and fairness for all selected contributors, we are seeking additional funding to support the remaining **6 contributors** with the same stipend amount as those officially accepted into GSoC.

### Intern Funding Breakdown

- **6 Interns x $3,000 = $18,000**

This funding will enable us to attract and retain high-quality contributors, maintain consistency, and deliver planned feature milestones efficiently.

## Use of Funds

The funds raised through this proposal will be used to:

- **Support Interns**: Provide stipends to 6 contributors not covered by official GSoC funding.
- **Accelerate Feature Development**: Speed up the implementation of new functionalities and improvements.
- **Hackathons**: Run monthly hackathons to encourage community contribution and innovation. 
- **Improve UX/UI**: Work with designers to enhance the usability and appeal of OWASP BLT.
- **Marketing and Outreach**: Promote the project to expand our contributor base and end-user adoption.
- **Operational Costs**: Cover infrastructure, hosting, tooling, and necessary subscriptions.

## Expected Outcomes

By securing this funding, we aim to:

- Accelerate the delivery of new features and fixes.
- Foster a more vibrant, inclusive contributor community.
- Match the quality, experience, and opportunities provided to all interns, regardless of GSoC selection.
- Improve overall project usability and adoption within the OWASP ecosystem and beyond.
- Ensure long-term sustainability through better contributor engagement and visibility.
