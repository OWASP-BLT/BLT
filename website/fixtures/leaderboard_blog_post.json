The new **Monthly Leaderboard Bot** brings transparency, fairness, and motivation to our contributor community.\n\n## What's New?\n\n### 📊 Comprehensive Point System\n\nOur new leaderboard tracks multiple types of contributions with a fair point system:\n\n- **Open Pull Requests**: +1 point each (encourages active contributions)\n- **Merged Pull Requests**: +10 points each (rewards successful contributions)\n- **Closed (not merged) PRs**: -2 points (encourages quality over quantity)\n- **Code Reviews**: +5 points each (first two reviews per PR count)\n- **Issue Comments**: +2 points each (values community engagement)\n- **CodeRabbit Discussions**: Configurable points with daily cap to prevent abuse\n\n### 🎯 Monthly Rankings\n\nThe leaderboard resets monthly (based on UTC timezone), giving everyone a fresh start and highlighting current active contributors. Rankings consider:\n\n1. Total points (primary sorting)\n2. Merged PRs (tiebreaker)\n3. Review count (secondary tiebreaker)\n4. Alphabetical order (final tiebreaker)\n\n### 🛡️ Anti-Abuse Features\n\nTo maintain quality and prevent spam:\n\n- **PR Limit**: Automatically closes PRs if a contributor has 50+ open PRs\n- **Bot Detection**: Automated accounts (like dependabot, copilot) are excluded\n- **Daily Caps**: CodeRabbit discussion points have configurable daily limits per user\n\n### 🏅 Automatic Leaderboard Comments\n\nEvery time a new pull request is opened, the bot automatically:\n\n- Posts a leaderboard comment showing your current ranking\n- Displays your position with nearby competitors\n- Shows medals (🥇🥈🥉) for top 3 contributors\n- Highlights your entry with ✨\n\n### 🔒 Security First\n\nThe action uses `pull_request_target` with careful security measures:\n\n- Only uses GitHub API (never checks out or executes PR code)\n- Safe execution even for PRs from forked repositories\n- Limited permissions (read contents, write PR comments)\n\n## Example Leaderboard\n\nHere's what a leaderboard comment looks like:\n\n```\n| Rank | User | Open PRs | PRs (merged) | PRs (closed) | Reviews | Comments | Total |\n|------|------|----------|--------------|--------------|---------|----------|-------|\n| 🥇 #1 | @contributor1 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 8 | 15 | **175** |\n| 🥈 #2 | @contributor2 | 3 | 10 | 1 | 6 | 12 | **151** |\n| #3 | **`@you`** ✨ | 2 | 8 | 0 | 5 | 10 | **112** |\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nRepository maintainers can configure:\n\n- **CR_DISCUSSION_MODE**: `visible` (show column), `hidden` (score but don't show), or `separate` (track but don't score)\n- **CR_DISCUSSION_POINTS**: Points awarded per CodeRabbit discussion (default: 0)\n- **CR_DISCUSSION_DAILY_CAP**: Maximum counted discussions per user per day (default: 7)\n\n## Impact on Contributors\n\nThis system encourages:\n\n- **Quality contributions** through the high value of merged PRs\n- **Community engagement** through review and comment points\n- **Active participation** through open PR bonuses\n- **Constructive feedback** through review rewards\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe leaderboard uses:\n\n- **GitHub GraphQL API** for efficient data fetching\n- **Smart pagination** to handle large repositories\n- **Monthly time windows** (UTC-based)\n- **Upsert logic** to update existing comments instead of spamming\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere's nothing you need to do! The leaderboard automatically runs when:\n\n- You open a new pull request\n- The bot posts/updates your ranking in the PR comments\n\nStart contributing, reviewing, and engaging with the community to climb the leaderboard!\n\n## Recognition & Credits\n\nThis enhancement was contributed by the community through **PR #5465**, demonstrating the collaborative spirit that makes open source projects thrive.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to compete?** Open your next PR and see where you rank! 🏆\n\n*Questions or feedback?
