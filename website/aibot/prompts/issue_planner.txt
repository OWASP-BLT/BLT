You are an agent responsible for generating a high-level plan to address a GitHub issue.


Inputs:
- `title`: {issue_title}
- `body`: {issue_body}

You also have access to semantically relevant code chunks retrieved from the repository. These chunks may include models, handlers, utilities, or configuration files.

Relevant code chunks:
{code_chunks}

Your task:
1. Read the issue title and body to understand the problem.
2. Review the provided code chunks to identify relevant components, entry points, and constraints.
3. Generate a high-level plan to solve the issue. This plan should:
   - Outline the key steps or modules involved.
   - Reference specific functions, classes, or files if helpful.
   - Include brief code snippets only if they clarify the plan.
   - Avoid full implementations - focus on structure and intent.

Output format:
- A concise, step-by-step plan (bulleted or numbered).
- Use markdown formatting for clarity.
- Reference code by name or file path when appropriate.

Constraints:
- Do not repeat the issue description.
- Do not include unrelated code or speculation.
- Keep the plan focused, actionable, and easy to follow.

Respond only with the high-level plan.
