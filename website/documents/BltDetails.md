The OWASP Bug Logging Tool (BLT) is a free, open-source web application designed to enable users to report software or hardware bugs found on any website. Launched as an official OWASP project in 2016, BLT encourages responsible disclosure and improves internet security by allowing anyone to submit bug reports. It has evolved significantly since its inception, becoming an OWASP production project in May 2023 and participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program for multiple years.

### Key Features and Functionality

1. **User Participation**: BLT allows users to report bugs they encounter on any website. Users earn points for each bug reported, and verified bugs can earn additional points. This gamified approach incentivizes bug hunting and ensures active participation.

2. **Bug Reporting Process**:
   - **Account Creation**: Users need to create an account to log into the BLT platform.
   - **Bug Submission**: Users describe the bug, attach a screenshot, and submit the report.
   - **Verification**: Bugs are verified through a community-driven process, where other users and the company confirm the validity of the report.

3. **Rewards System**: Users can win rewards by participating in company-sponsored bug hunts, earning prize money through tips, and competing for grand prizes or jackpots. Companies can launch their own bug hunts and set specific rewards for discovering bugs on their websites.

4. **Community and Contribution**: BLT fosters a vibrant community with regular updates and contributions from users. The project welcomes contributions and has guidelines for new contributors. It also participates in various initiatives like the OWASP Incubator Project Initiative and GSoC, highlighting its commitment to community-driven development.

### Technical Details

- **Open Source**: BLT is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0, ensuring it remains free and open for anyone to use and contribute to.
- **Development and Maintenance**: The project is continuously updated with new features and improvements, supported by contributions from the community and participation in development programs like GSoC.
