#### 1. Component Overview
The Bug Report Form in the OWASP Bug Logging Tool (BLT) application is designed to facilitate the submission of detailed bug reports by users. Its primary purpose is to collect all necessary information regarding a bug or issue found on a website, enabling accurate tracking, verification, and resolution. The form supports a structured approach to reporting, ensuring that all relevant details are captured systematically.

#### 2. User Interaction
Users interact with the Bug Report Form through a series of steps designed to capture comprehensive information about the bug. The process is straightforward and user-friendly, allowing even those with minimal technical knowledge to submit detailed reports. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Enter Domain URL**: The user inputs the URL of the website where the bug was encountered in the "Domain URL" field. This is crucial for pinpointing the exact location of the issue.
2. **Check for Duplicates**: Users can click the "Check for Duplicates" button to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
3. **Fill in the Bug Title**: A concise and descriptive title is entered in the "Bug Title" field, summarizing the nature of the bug.
4. **Select Bug Type**: The user selects the appropriate category for the bug from the "Bug Type" dropdown menu, which helps in classifying and prioritizing the issue.
5. **Choose Bug Hunt Option**: Users can select "Report Independently" or choose from a list of active bug hunts they are participating in, using the "Bug Hunt" dropdown.
6. **Upload Screenshots**: Users can upload screenshots to illustrate the bug. This is done by dragging and dropping images into the "Upload screenshots" area or by pasting images directly. The form supports PNG, JPG, and GIF formats, with a limit of up to five images.
7. **Enter CVE ID**: If the bug is a known vulnerability, users can enter the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID in the "CVE ID" field. This helps in referencing standardized information.
8. **Describe the Bug**: In the "Bug Description" section, users provide a detailed description of the bug. The markdown editor allows for text formatting, adding images, and embedding links. Users can preview their input to ensure clarity and completeness.
9. **Add Team Members**: Users can add email addresses of team members who are also involved in the bug hunt. This is done in the "Add Team Members" section, enhancing collaboration.
10. **Complete CAPTCHA**: To validate the submission, users must solve a CAPTCHA challenge, which prevents automated submissions and ensures security.
