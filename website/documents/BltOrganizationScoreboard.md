Users interact with the Organization Scoreboard through the following steps:
1. **Viewing the Scoreboard**: Users can browse the list of organizations displayed on the scoreboard.
2. **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort and filter the organizations based on different criteria, such as the number of open or closed issues.
3. **Accessing Organization Details**: By clicking on a organization name or logo, users can navigate to a detailed page specific to that organization to view more information about the reported issues.
4. **Pagination**: Users can navigate through multiple pages of the scoreboard using the pagination controls at the bottom.
