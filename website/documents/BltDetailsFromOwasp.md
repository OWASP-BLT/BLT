OWASP Bug Logging Tool
Introduction

OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is a powerful tool designed to allow everyone who uses the internet to
help improve it. With BLT, users can submit any type of issue they encounter, whether it's a simple design
flaw like a button being the wrong color, or a serious security vulnerability. By following responsible
disclosure ethics, BLT helps to ensure that reported issues are addressed in a timely and appropriate
manner.

One unique feature of BLT is that it rewards users for reporting bugs. As users report more issues, they
earn more points, which can be verified for extra points. Additionally, companies and organizations can get
involved with BLT and launch their own bughunt programs with prize pools. This not only incentivizes users.
to report bugs but also encourages companies to actively seek out and address vulnerabilities before they
can be exploited.

 

Overall, OWASP BLT is an important tool for improving internet security and promoting responsible
disclosure practices. By allowing anyone to report issues, rewarding users for their contributions, and
providing a platform for companies to launch bughunt programs, BLT empowers individuals and
organizations to work together towards a safer and more secure online environment.

Contributing

This is a call for contributions to a project called BLT. The project has a list of issues that are tagged as
“good first issue” to help new contributors get started. There are also guidelines for contributing to the
project. If you find a bug or have an improvement, you can report it using BLT. To make sure your
contribution is linked to the relevant issue, create a new branch with the button on the right of the issue to
create a new branch. Additionally, if you want to take ownership of an issue, you can use the comment

“assign to me” or /assign to assign it to yourself. Contributing to the project is appreciated and benefits both

the project and the contributor. Contributions are always welcome and appreciated! To get started with
contributing, please check out our Contribution Guidelines. We have a list of issues that are tagged with
“good first issue” to help newcomers get started. You can also join our OWASP Slack Channel and ask

12. How to use ChatGPT to contribute to the project ?

OpenAl's ChatGPT can be a helpful tool when it comes to assisting with projects like OWASP's bug
logging tool. As a large language model trained on a variety of sources, it can generate human-like
text based on the inputs provided to it. You can use it to facilitate many parts of your development
process, including but not limited to troubleshooting, code generation, documentation writing, and
testing. Here's a detailed way to approach this:

1. Development Phase:

« Code Reviews and Troubleshooting: ChatGPT can provide advice on code optimization,
best practices, and debugging. You can ask it for input on your Django, Flutter, JavaScript
code, or any other language's code.

Code Generation: For quick prototyping or generating boilerplate code, you can ask
ChatGPT to generate snippets. For example, you might need a quick Django model or a
Flutter widget.

Documentation: Writing documentation can be time-consuming. ChatGPT can help by
generating documentation based on your code and requirements. You simply need to
provide a clear description of what the function or component does, and ChatGPT can help
generate an appropriate documentation comment.

2. Testing Phase:

= Generating Test Cases: You can ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm and generate
various test cases to ensure your code works as expected under different circumstances.

« Writing Test Scripts: Similar to code generation, you can ask ChatGPT to help you write
test scripts. Provide a clear description of the test, and it can generate a basic test script for
you.

3. User Support:

« User Queries: You can integrate ChatGPT as a part of your support team to respond to
user queries. You would need to train it on your specific product using Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) so it can answer queries accurately and
contextually.

4. Project Management:

« Generating Reports: You can ask ChatGPT to help you generate progress reports, or any
other text-based reports. Provide it with the necessary data, and a brief about what the
report needs to convey.

«= Communication: You can use ChatGPT to help draft project updates, emails, or any other
communications you might have with stakeholders.

5. GitHub Action:

« Automating Tasks: ChatGPT could be used in a GitHub Action to automate various tasks.
For example, it could be used to automatically generate release notes based on merged
PRs, or to check for specific code style in PRs.

6. Browser Extension:

« User Interface: You can use ChatGPT to assist users on the extension. For example, you
might use it to help users navigate the extension or troubleshoot problems. It could also be
used to generate helpful suggestions or tips based on the context of the user's current
webpage.

 

Remember that GPT-4, like all Al models, is a tool that can help assist in various tasks, but it won't replace
human judgment and expertise. Always review and consider the suggestions it provides, and don't use it
for sensitive tasks without appropriate checks in place.

Remember to comply with OpenAl's use case policy and ensure that the usage of ChatGPT is ethical,
privacy-preserving, and secure.
