                            Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first
                            classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
                            datepickers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                            you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                            Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                            bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                            Tailwind CSS.

                        <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
                        <p>
                            First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
                            Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
                            documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
                            and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">quickstart
                            guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
                            to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                            purge and minify the generated CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
                            you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">comparison table</a> to better understand
                            the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.

                        <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
                        <p>
                            While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                            will come in handy:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                                follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                                usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                                properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                                providing your client with a hands-on experience;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                                design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.

                        <p>
                            A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across
                            letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.

                        <h4>Serif</h4>
                        <p>
                            A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter.
                            Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the
                            following:

                            <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
                            <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>

                        <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to
                            the real deal. If you’re simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
                            prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than
                            enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with
                            on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user
                            would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,
                            considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right
                            path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more
                            user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what will
                            be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order
                            of priority. This way, you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at the heart
                            of your design.
                        </p>

                            creation of the design strategy.
