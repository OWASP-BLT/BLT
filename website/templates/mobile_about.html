    <strong>{% trans "Introduction" %}</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    {% trans "OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is a powerful tool designed to allow everyone who uses the internet to help improve it. With BLT, users can submit any type of issue they encounter, whether it’s a simple design flaw like a button being the wrong color, or a serious security vulnerability. By following responsible disclosure ethics, BLT helps to ensure that reported issues are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner." %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans "One unique feature of BLT is that it rewards users for reporting bugs. As users report more issues, they earn more points, which can be verified for extra points. Additionally, companies and organizations can get involved with BLT and launch their own bughunt programs with prize pools. This not only incentivizes users to report bugs but also encourages companies to actively seek out and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited." %}
</p>
<p>
    {% trans "Overall, OWASP BLT is an important tool for improving internet security and promoting responsible disclosure practices. By allowing anyone to report issues, rewarding users for their contributions, and providing a platform for companies to launch bughunt programs, BLT empowers individuals and organizations to work together towards a safer and more secure online environment." %}
