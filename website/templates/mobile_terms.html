If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a Organizations or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access our services through your account to these terms and conditions. In such cases, the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity, its affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority or do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use the services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that if you are accessing any {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} service as a government entity, special terms may apply to you.

        <p>
            If {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service.

        <p>
            Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your account. While {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} prohibits such conduct and content on the Service, you understand and agree that {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} cannot be responsible for the content posted on the Service, and you may be exposed to such materials.

            Customers may access their {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %}, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:

        <ol>
            <li>
                You expressly understand and agree that {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abuse or excessively frequent requests to {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. {% env 'PROJECT_NAME' %} will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
