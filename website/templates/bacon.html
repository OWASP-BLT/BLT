                        BACON (Blockchain Assisted Contribution Network) is an innovative project within the OWASP BLT platform that integrates Bitcoin Core technology and the Runes protocol to reward contributors with blockchain-based incentives. By leveraging the power of blockchain, BACON ensures transparency, security, and fairness in the distribution of rewards, ultimately enhancing the quality and security of open-source software.
