# Organization Invite Points System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the missing points awarding logic for organization invites. When a user invites an organization and that organization registers via the referral link, the inviting user now receives 5 points.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Organization Registration View (`website/views/company.py`)
- **Added imports**: `InviteOrganization`, `Points`
- **Added points logic**: After successful organization creation, check for referral code in session
- **Award 5 points**: Create Points record for the inviting user
- **Update invite record**: Mark `points_awarded=True` and link to created organization
- **Prevent double points**: Only award points if `points_awarded=False`

### 2. Improved Invite View (`website/views/core.py`)
- **Fixed placeholder issue**: Removed creation of fake placeholder invites
- **Generate sample links**: Use UUID for display-only referral links
- **Better context**: Added proper template variables for email generation
- **Security improvement**: Sample links can't be used to claim points

### 3. Updated Template (`website/templates/invite.html`)
- **Sample link indicator**: Different messages for real vs sample referral links
- **User context**: Show appropriate messages based on login status

### 4. Consolidated URL Routing (`blt/urls.py`)
- **Single invite view**: Use `invite_organization` function from core.py
- **Removed duplicate**: Eliminated unused `InviteCreate` class from user.py

### 5. Comprehensive Tests (`website/test_organization_invite.py`)
- **Points awarding**: Test that 5 points are awarded on successful registration
- **No double points**: Test that same referral code can't be used twice
- **Invalid codes**: Test that invalid referral codes don't award points
- **Sample links**: Test that sample links don't award points
- **Anonymous users**: Test behavior for non-logged-in users

## How It Works

1. **User creates invite**: Logged-in user fills invite form â†’ `InviteOrganization` record created
2. **Referral link generated**: Unique referral code appended to organization registration URL
3. **Organization visits link**: Referral code stored in session
4. **Organization registers**: Registration form submitted successfully
5. **Points awarded**: System finds matching invite record and awards 5 points to sender
6. **Invite updated**: Mark as used and link to created organization

## Key Features

 **5 points per successful invite**  
 **Prevents duplicate point awards**  
 **Secure referral tracking**  
 **Works for logged-in users only**  
 **Sample links for demonstration**  
 **Comprehensive test coverage**  

## Security Considerations

- Only real invite records (not sample links) can award points
- Referral codes are unique UUIDs
- Points only awarded once per invite
- Session-based referral tracking prevents tampering
- Invalid referral codes are handled gracefully

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python manage.py test website.test_organization_invite
```

The implementation includes tests for all major scenarios including edge cases and security
