  ```
    <script type="text/javascript">
		var button = document.createElement("Button");
		button.style = "bottom:15px;left:15px;position:fixed;z-index: 12;border-radius:100%;background: url('https://www.bugheist.com/static/img/logo.0cc160e97934.png') no-repeat center; height: 50px; width: 50px; outline: none;background-size: 50px 50px;"
		document.body.appendChild(button);
		var url = window.location.href;
		var bugheist = 'https://www.bugheist.com/report/?url=' + url;
		button.onclick = function() {
			var redirectWindow = window.open(bugheist, '_blank');
            redirectWindow.location;

## Notes

- If you find a bug or have an improvement, use BLT to report it!
- Our staging server is at https://bugheist-staging.herokuapp.com/ - staging uses the master branch and we have review apps setup that deploy a new instance for each pull request. 
- for each new issue, create a new branch with issue-382 or similar matching the issue number - when you commit add fixes #288 to link the issue to the pull request
- Our Figma desins are also Open Source you can see them here https://www.figma.com/file/s0xuxeU6O2guoWEfA9OElZ/Bugheist-Full-Design to contribute to the design, add a pull request to the design changes file and we will merge them into our main figma file.
- to take a github issue type a comment that says "assign to me" and it will assign it to you.
