## Notes

  

  

- If you find a bug or have an improvement, use BLT to report it!

  

- for each new issue, create a new branch with issue-382 or similar matching the issue number - when you commit add fixes #288 to link the issue to the pull request

  

- to take a github issue type a comment that says "assign to me" or /assign and it will assign it to you.
