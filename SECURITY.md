# Security Policy

At OWASP BLT, we take security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, our responsible disclosure process, and how we handle security issues.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of OWASP BLT:

| Version | Supported          |

Older versions may not receive security updates. We strongly recommend that users upgrade to the latest version.
