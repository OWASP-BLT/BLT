# Security Policy

At OWASP BLT, security is in our name. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, our responsible disclosure process, and how we handle security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in OWASP BLT, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly and promptly. Here's how you can report it:

### 1. GitHub Security Advisory

You can report the vulnerability by creating a GitHub Security Advisory: [OWASP BLT Security Page](https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT/security/advisories/new)

Follow the prompts to submit a private security advisory.

### 2. Responsible Disclosure Process

We ask security researchers to:
- Allow us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure (typically 90 days)
- Follow up every 30 days on the advisory thread to check on the progress
- Not exploit the vulnerability or demonstrate it on live systems
- Not disclose the vulnerability to others until we've released a patch

In return, we commit to:
- If it's a valid report, we may acknowledge it and work with you to establish a timeline for addressing the vulnerability. We are not obliged to acknowledge any report, especially if it's low quality or inaccurate.
- We aim to provide an initial response within 1–7 days of receiving your report.
- We will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the issue.
- Once the issue is fixed, we will release a patch. We may or may not publicly disclose the vulnerability depending on the severity and affected users. If users are affected, we will do our best to contact them.
- If you wish to be credited for the discovery, please let us know in your report. You may also choose to remain anonymous.

## Bug Bounties

Currently, we do not offer bounties for security vulnerability reports. To find out if we offer bounties in the future, please check the BLT project on the [BLT homepage](https://owaspblt.org).

## Vulnerability Handling Process - (if a valid security issue is found)

- **Triage**: The Project Leaders will review the report and assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- **Fix Development**: A fix will be developed and tested for the vulnerability.
- **Release and Disclosure**: A patched version will be released. The vulnerability may or may not be publicly disclosed depending on the severity and affected users.
