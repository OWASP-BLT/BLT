# Security Policy

At OWASP BLT, security is in our name. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, our responsible disclosure process, and how we handle security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in OWASP BLT, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly and promptly. Here's how you can report it:

### 1. GitHub Security Advisory

You can report the vulnerability by creating a GitHub Security Advisory: [OWASP BLT Security Page](https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT/security/advisories/new)

Follow the prompts to submit a private security advisory.

### 2. Responsible Disclosure Process

We ask security researchers to:
- Allow us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure (typically 90 days)
- Not exploit the vulnerability or demonstrate it on live systems
- Not disclose the vulnerability to others until we've released a patch

In return, we commit to:
- We will acknowledge your report and work with you to establish a timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- We aim to provide an initial response within 48-72 hours of receiving your report.
- We will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the issue.
- Once the issue is fixed, we will release a patch and publicly disclose the vulnerability.
- If you wish to be credited for the discovery, please let us know in your report. You may also choose to remain anonymous.

## Bug Bounties

OWASP BLT may offer rewards for valid security vulnerabilities reported through responsible disclosure. Bounty eligibility and amounts are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on:

- **Severity**: Critical vulnerabilities affecting user data, authentication, or system integrity
- **Impact**: Potential harm to users or the platform
- **Quality**: Clear reproduction steps and detailed documentation

Not all reports are eligible for bounties. The decision to award a bounty is at the discretion of the project maintainers. To be considered for a bounty, please indicate your interest in your initial report.

## Vulnerability Handling Process - (if a valid security issue is found)

- **Triage**: The Project Leaders will review the report and assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- **Fix Development**: A fix will be developed and tested for the vulnerability.
- **Release**: A patched version will be released.
- **Disclosure**: The vulnerability may be publicly disclosed with appropriate details.
