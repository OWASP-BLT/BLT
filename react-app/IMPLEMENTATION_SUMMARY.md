- Main project README updated with React version info

## Technical Details

### Build Performance
```
Production Build Output:
- HTML: 0.46 KB
- CSS: 20.19 KB (5.72 KB gzipped)
- JavaScript: 290.25 KB (92.24 KB gzipped)
```

### Color Scheme
Primary color: `#e74c3c` (BLT red)
- Applied consistently throughout the app
- Used in buttons, links, headings, and accents
- Hover states: `#c0392b` (darker red)

### Code Quality
- ✅ No inline styles (all CSS classes)
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Proper component structure
- ✅ ESLint configuration included
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities (CodeQL scan passed)

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)
The app is ready to deploy to Cloudflare Pages with:
- Automatic builds on git push
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Global CDN distribution
- Free tier sufficient for most use cases

### Build Configuration
```
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
Root directory: react-app
Environment variables: VITE_API_URL
```

## Testing Results

### Build Tests
✅ Production build succeeds without errors
✅ All assets properly generated
✅ Cloudflare files included in dist

### Runtime Tests
✅ Dev server starts successfully
✅ All routes accessible
✅ Navigation works correctly
✅ API integration configured
✅ Responsive design verified

### Security Tests
✅ CodeQL scan passed (0 vulnerabilities)
✅ Dependencies up-to-date
✅ Security headers configured

## Architecture

### Frontend (React)
```
User Browser
    ↓
Cloudflare Pages (React SPA)
    ↓ API Calls
Django REST API
    ↓
Database
```

### Benefits
1. **Performance**: Static site hosted on global CDN
2. **Scalability**: Cloudflare handles all traffic
3. **Cost**: Free hosting on Cloudflare Pages
4. **Modern UX**: React provides smooth interactions
5. **Separation**: Frontend can be updated independently

## Files Changed/Added

### New Files (32 total)
- React application structure
- Components and pages
- Services and configuration
- Documentation
